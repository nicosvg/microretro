# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up comprehensive documentation system for the Microretro project to ensure continuity and effective development.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Setup**: Created foundational documentation structure following Cursor's memory bank pattern
- **Project Documentation**: Established core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md)
- **Architecture Documentation**: Documented current system architecture and design patterns

## Current State
The project has a functional retrospective board application with:
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket communication
- ✅ Card creation and management
- ✅ User authentication and board joining
- ✅ Voting system
- ✅ Board state management
- ✅ Database persistence with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Frontend UI with SvelteKit

## Active Decisions
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Following Cursor's recommended pattern for project documentation
2. **Documentation Priority**: Focusing on core architectural understanding before detailed feature documentation
3. **Development Continuity**: Ensuring future development sessions can quickly understand project context

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Create progress.md and any additional context files
2. **Review Current Implementation**: Validate documented patterns against actual codebase
3. **Identify Gaps**: Find areas where documentation needs enhancement
4. **Update Rules**: Ensure .cursor/rules reflects current project patterns

## Key Considerations
- **Real-time Performance**: WebSocket implementation must remain efficient
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript usage across all layers
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage for critical paths
- **User Experience**: Keep the interface simple and intuitive

## Open Questions
- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that need more detailed documentation?
- Should we document specific API endpoints and their contracts?
- Are there any deployment or configuration details that should be captured?

## Context for Future Sessions
This memory bank provides the foundation for understanding:
- Project purpose and goals
- Technical architecture and patterns
- Current implementation status
- Development workflow and tools
