- **Real-time**: Instant updates without page refreshes
- **Scalable**: Support multiple concurrent boards and users
- **Modern stack**: Use current best practices and technologies

## Success Criteria
- Teams can complete a full retrospective cycle (write → vote → discuss)
- All participants see real-time updates
- System remains responsive with multiple concurrent users
- Minimal friction in the user experience

## Constraints
- Keep the application focused on core retrospective functionality
- Maintain simplicity over feature complexity
