# Group cards

## Creating groups

- A group is created when a user drag and drops a card onto another card
- A group has a title that can be set and edited after creation
- A group is linked to a board and a column
- A card loses its column when added to a group

## Editing groups

- The user can add a card to a group by dragging and dropping the card
  on an existing group
- We can remove a card from a group by dragging it and dropping it
  outside of the group

## Deleting groups

- Dragging the last card of a group outside of the group will delete the group
