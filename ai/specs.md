# Group cards

## Creating groups

- A group is created when a user drag and drops a card onto another card
- A group is linked to a board and a column
- A group can have a title that can be set and edited after creation

## Editing groups

- The user can add a card to a group by dragging and dropping the card
  on an existing group or on a card in an existing group
- The user can remove a card from a group by dragging it and dropping it
  in an other group or on a column

## Deleting groups

- Dragging the last card of a group outside of the group will delete the group

## Voting on group

- Only the first card of the group can be voted on
- Later we will allow reordering the cards
