# AI summary of retrospective

- On the last step (DONE) of the retrospective, the users will see
  a summary of what has been said in the tickets
- This summary will be generated by AI. Use the getCompletion function from the aiChatPort
- It will summarize the 3 most voted tickets, and then add
  a quick bullet point summary of other topics (topics that were less voted, or not voted but had multiple occurences)
- There will be a button on the page to copy the summary to the clipboard.
  When copied, it will be saved as Markdown
- The order of topics if there is a tie is not important
- The summary should be stored in the database in the board table
- The summary should be computed when we change steps to go to the last step (DONE)
