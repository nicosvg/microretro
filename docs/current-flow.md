# Analysis of Current Retrospective Flow

## Key Components and Their Interactions

Based on examination of the codebase, here's a comprehensive analysis of the current retrospective flow:

### 1. Core Domain Components

- **Board Entity** (`domain/board.ts`): Central entity representing a retrospective session with states like "creation", "collection", "grouping", "voting", and "action". Contains references to cards and manages the overall retrospective lifecycle.

- **Card Entity** (`domain/card.ts`): Represents individual retrospective items with different types (likely "positive", "negative", "action", etc.). Contains content, author information, and metadata.

- **User Entity** (`domain/user.ts`): Manages user identity and authentication throughout the retrospective process.

### 2. Flow Sequence

The retrospective process follows this sequence:

1. **Board Creation**

   - User creates a new board through `BoardCreationComponent`
   - Sets title, participants, and configuration options
   - Backend creates a new board entity in "creation" state

2. **Card Collection Phase**

   - Board transitions to "collection" state
   - `CardCollectionComponent` allows participants to add cards of different types
   - Cards are stored in the board and synchronized across participants

3. **Grouping Phase**

   - Board transitions to "grouping" state
   - `CardGroupingComponent` enables facilitator/participants to organize similar cards together
   - Cards are assigned to groups for better discussion organization

4. **Voting Phase**

   - Board transitions to "voting" state
   - `VotingComponent` allows participants to vote on cards/groups
   - Voting results are tallied and stored with the board

5. **Action Items Phase**

   - Board transitions to "action" state
   - `ActionItemComponent` facilitates creation of action items based on discussions
   - Action items are assigned to team members with deadlines

6. **Completion**
   - Board is marked as "completed" when all actions are recorded
   - Currently no summary is presented (target for new feature)

### 3. Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Likely using Svelte stores to maintain board state
- **API Communication**: REST endpoints for CRUD operations on boards and cards
- **Real-time Updates**: Possibly using WebSockets for collaborative features
- **Routing**: Svelte routing to handle different views based on board state

### 4. Current Limitations

- No dedicated summary view at the end of the retrospective
- Limited analytics on retrospective patterns
- No export functionality for retrospective results

The new summary feature will need to be integrated after the "action" phase but before final completion, creating a new state in the flow to display aggregated results of the retrospective session.
